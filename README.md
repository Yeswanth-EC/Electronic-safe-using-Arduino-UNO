# Electronic-safe-using-Arduino-UNO
Designing an electronic safe using a servo motor, a Bluetooth module, and Arduino Uno allows remote access via smartphone, along with local access through the keypad or other input mechanisms.

STEPS:
1. Connect the Arduino, Bluetooth Module and servo as shown in the circuit diagram

2. Upload the Arduino Sketch code into the, uhh, Arduino of course. Make sure to unplug the RX pin first before uploading the code or else you will get an error

3. Create a App using MIT app Inventor

4. Open the app and establish a connection with the bluetooth module by pressing the "Connect to Bluetooth Module" button on the app

5. The bluetooth module's light should stop blinking once connection has been established.
